# EE 123 Lab 1: Time Domain Signals and Sonar

This lab introduces time-domain signal processing through hands-on experiments with audio signals. You'll work with chirp signals, cross-correlation, and build a simple sonar system using your computer's speaker and microphone.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x with NumPy, SciPy, and Matplotlib
- `sounddevice` package for audio I/O
- A computer with working speakers and microphone

## Lab Structure

| File | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `python_tutorial.ipynb` | Python/NumPy basics (optional review) |
| `lab1-part1-dtft.ipynb` | DTFT fundamentals and basic signal processing |
| `lab1-part2-TimeDomain-Sonar.ipynb` | Chirp generation, cross-correlation, and sonar basics |
| `lab1-part3-Distance-Measurement.ipynb` | Acoustic distance measurement application |

## Getting Started

1. Make sure your audio devices are properly configured
2. Work through the notebooks in order (Part 1 → Part 2 → Part 3)
3. For the sonar experiments, use a quiet environment for best results

## Notes

- **This lab is recommended to be completed on the lab desktops** due to audio interface requirements for the sonar experiments
- Adjust your system's microphone and speaker volume to avoid clipping or weak signals
- The sonar works best when the mic and speaker point in the same direction
